## The Qube
GogBot 2020 - Quantum social platform

This project was made as an installations within the Have Fun & Play! project. In this project, first yearsâ€™ students Creative Technology develop interactive installations for the GOGBOT multimedia art festival.
The aim of this years' GOGBOT was to make visitors aware of the coming Quantum Supremacy. This installation tries to show possible advancements in AI when Quantum Computers are introduced into our society, by showcasing different social media platforms that may emerge with quantum computers as users.

**See the installation**

The installation is currently hosted on the Have Fun & Play! project-website. You can see this installation by visiting: https://group10.mod4.nl/.
If the project-website is no longer available, see below for local-deployment instructions.

**Technical Details**

The website is built upon a Apache server, combined with a MySQL database for the user-posts and media. The front-end is written in plain HTML5, styled in plain CSS4. There are some client-side scripts in JavaScript but the majority of the pages is dynamically loaded with server-sided processing in PHP7. The database can be accessed through low-level SQL commands as well as a top-level GUI named PHPMyAdmin.
